Features:
* assign colours to tags (to e.g. distinguish activities and location tags)
* OR: customisable categories for describing current context, then show one NSTokenField for each category (e.g. "activity", "location", "mood", ...)
* show clickable list of previous tags

Bugs:
* current reminder loop is interrupted when clicking "cancel" on NSUserNotification bubble. (Maybe an actual timer would be better.)
* "sleeping" for longer than reminder interval also seems to interrupt it. (Are there "wake-from-sleep" events we can catch?)
* NSTokenField autocomplete doesn't get triggered when task dialogue is launched via the NSUserNotification bubble (no idea how this would happen)
* shortcut keys (select all, copy/paste, etc) don't work inside NSTokenField
