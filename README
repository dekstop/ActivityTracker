== ActivityTracker

A simple OS X utility that helps you keep track of how you spend your time. 

Use short comma-separated tags to describe activities, your location, your 
mood, or anything else that relates to your current context. These tags are 
logged in a file so you can refer to them later.

The activity tracker can be opened in several ways:
* selecting "Track an Activity Now..." from the ActivityTracker menu
* using the global keyboard shortcut, CMD-ยง

A notification pop-up can optionally remind you in regular intervals to track 
your current activity.
